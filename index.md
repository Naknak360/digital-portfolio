# About Me

* * *

Hi, I'm Nathan Nakamura, and this is my digital portfolio! I am currently a second year student studying computer engineering at the University of California, San Diego. Although I am taking both electrical engineering and computer science courses, I have found that I do like the software side of computers much more than I do the hardware side, which is why I hope to switch into a full-fledged computer science student by the end of this year.
